Notes
Terms shown in all caps inside of angle brackets (<>) are the XML tag names in the sample simulation data file.

Plant
Plants grow from seeds in a hemispherical form, that is, it will be as high as the radius of its circular area on the ground. 
A plant seed will begin growing 10 seconds of simulation time after it is ejected from its’ parent. 
  In this first growth it will start with a radius of 1/100 of a DU.
A plant grows at a rate defined in a simulation data file (<GROWTH_RATE>) as a fraction of its’ maximum size.
The maximum size of a plant is defined in a simulation data file (<MAX_SIZE>).
The plant continues to grow until it reaches its maximum size after which every hour of simulation time it will produce a seedpod which will pop spreading a random number of seeds. 
  The maximum number of seeds that can be produced is defined in a simulation data file (<MAX_SEED_NUMBER>).  
  The seeds will be distributed in a circular region around the plant.  
  The maximum distance a seed can be thrown is defined in a simulation data file (<MAX_SEED_CAST_DISTANCE>).
A percentage of the seeds distributed will germinate and grow.  
  The percentage of viable seeds is defined in a simulation data file (<SEED_VIABILITY>).
The number of plants present when the simulation starts is defined in a simulation data file (<INITIAL_PLANT_COUNT>).
A plant will be defined in the data file with an X and Y coordinate (<X_POS> and <Y_POS>) and a diameter <P_DIAMETER>.

Grazer
Grazers feed on plants.
When food is available the Grazer is able to eat enough to gain a number of EU per minute of simulation time.  
  The number of EUs gained is defined in a simulation data file (<ENERGY_INPUT>).
After 10 minutes of simulation time the Grazer will have eaten all food with in its’ reach (5 DU) and will have to move.
A Grazer will expend a number of EU each time it moves 5 DU.  
  The amount of energy expended is defined in a simulation data file (<ENERGY_OUTPUT>). 
  The energy output is the same whether the Grazer is looking for food or fleeing from a Predator. 
A Grazer can see any edible plant that is within its’ direct line of sight (not blocked by other obstructions) and within 150 DU of it.
If a Grazer’s energy level drops below 25 it will be unable to move more than 10 DU because of weakness.
If a Grazer’s energy level drops to zero it dies and disappears from the simulation.
If a Grazer’s energy level rises above a level as defined in the data file (<ENERGY_TO_REPRODUCE> it will reproduce and produce two Grazer organisms each of which will have half of the original Grazer’s energy level. 
A Grazer will see a Predator if it is within 25 DU and not hidden by an obstruction.  
  It will attempt to escape by running or hiding behind an obstruction.  
A Grazer can run faster than a Predator but only for a time defined in a simulation data file for a given number of simulation minutes (<MAINTAIN_SPEED>), it will then slow to 75% of its’ maximum speed <MAX_SPEED>. 
The initial number of grazers, their energy levels, and locations will be defined in a simulation data file.
A grazer will be defined in the data file with an X and Y coordinate (<X_POS> and <Y_POS>) and an initial energy level <G_ENERGY_LEVEL>.

Predator
The Predators feed on the Grazers.
Predators shall have a limited set of genetic traits as defined below which will determine its reactions to other Predators and to Grazers.
Aggression
Dominant Gene = A
Recessive Gene = a
Genotypes
Homozygous Dominant = AA – Predators with AA genotype are most aggressive.  
                           They will attempt to kill and eat other Predators unless seeking a mate.
Heterozygous Dominant = Aa – Predators with Aa genotype are moderately aggressive.  
                             They will attack other Predators only when hungry and no other food is available.
Homozygous Recessive = aa – Predators with aa genotype are non-aggressive.  
                            They will always flee when approached or attacked by other Predators.  
                            They will only approach another Predator when driven by the mating urge.
Strength
Dominant Gene = S
Recessive Gene = s
Genotypes
Homozygous Dominant = SS – 
    Predators with SS genotype are the strongest and will succeed in killing and eating Grazers 95% of the time if they are caught.  
    If they attack another Predator they will succeed in killing and eating that Predator 75% of the time if its’ strength is Ss and 95% of the time if its’ strength is ss. 
    If two Predators with genotype SS fight there is a 50% chance one or the other will kill and eat and 50% chance they will disengage and go their own way.  
    If one does kill and eat the other there is an even chance as to which will succeed.
Heterozygous Dominant = Ss – 
    Predators with Ss genotype are moderately strong and will succeed in killing and eating Grazers 75% of the time if they are caught.  
    If they attack another Predator they will succeed in killing and eating that Predator 25% of the time if its’ strength is SS and 75% of the time if its strength is ss.  
    If two Predators with genotype Ss fight there is a 50% chance one or the other will kill and eat and 50% chance they will disengage and go their own way.  
    If one does kill and eat the other there is an even chance as to which will succeed.
Homozygous Recessive = ss – 
    Predators with ss genotype are weakest and will succeed in killing and eating Grazers 50% of the time if they are caught.  
    If they attack another Predator they will succeed in killing and eating that Predator 5% of the time if its’ strength is SS and 25% of the time if its strength is Ss.  If two Predators with genotype ss fight there is a 50% chance one or the other will kill and eat and 50% chance they will disengage and go their own way.  
    If one does kill and eat the other there is an even chance as to which will succeed.

Speed - The maximum speeds a Predator can run (see tags below) and the times it can maintain that maximum speed (<MAINTAIN_SPEED>) is defined in the data file.  
       Speeds are given in DU per minute and times in minutes.  
       After the maintain speed time is elapsed the Predator will slow at a rate of one DU per 15 seconds of simulation time till it comes to a stop.  
Dominant Gene = F
Recessive Gene = f
Genotypes
Homozygous Dominant = FF – Predators with FF genotype are the fastest running (<MAX_SPEED_HOD>).  
Heterozygous Dominant = Ff – Predators with Ff genotype are moderate speed runners (<MAX_SPEED_HED>).
Homozygous Recessive = ff – Predators with ff genotype are the slowest runners (<MAX_SPEED_HOR>).

A Predator will expend a number of EU each time it moves 5 DU.  
  The amount of energy expended is defined in a simulation data file (<ENERGY_OUTPUT>). 
  The energy output is the same whether the Predator is looking for food or chasing a Grazer. 
When a Predator kills and eats a Grazer or another Predator it will gain 90% of that organism’s energy.
A Predator will see a Grazer or another Predator that is within its’ direct line of sight (not blocked by other obstructions) and within 150 DU of it.
A Predator will smell a Grazer or another Predator even if it is not within its’ direct line of sight and within 25 DU of it.
When a Predator’s energy level reaches a level defined in a simulation data file (<ENERGY_TO_REPRODUCE>) it will seek another predator and mate.  
  Predators are bisexual, meaning they are both male and female but must mate with another Predator to reproduce.  
  After mating each of the pair will give birth to a random number of new Predators up to a maximum number of offspring as defined in a simulation data file (<MAX_OFFSPRING>). 
  The gestation period <GESTATION> is also defined in simulation days in the simulation data file.
The genetic makeup of each offspring shall be determined by Mendel’s laws of genetics.
Each offspring will receive one gene for each trait from each parent. 
  For example: if two predators each with genes Aa for aggression mate their offspring may get an AA, Aa, or aa combination.  
               For each parent and for each trait there is a 50:50 chance of receiving either of the parent genes.
After giving birth a Predator and it’s offspring will move away from each other and not react to the other for one simulation hour.
Predator offspring are born with an energy level defined in a simulation data file. 
  This does not diminish the parent’s energy level.
Predator offspring have all the characteristics of an adult when born.  
The initial number of predators, their energy levels, and locations will be defined in a simulation data file.
A predator will be defined in the data file with an X and Y coordinate (<X_POS> and <Y_POS>), an initial energy level <P_ENERGY_LEVEL> and a char array giving the genotype <GENOTYPE>.

Obstacle
An obstacle can be thought of as a round dome shaped rock.
An obstacle will be defined in the data file with an X and Y coordinate (<X_POS> and <Y_POS>), a diameter  <O_DIAMETER> and a height  <O_HEIGHT>.
