# CS 499 Senior Project: Life Simulation

## Rationale
# Inspired by John H. Conway's "Game of Life," this project simulates living organism behavior. It's a medium-complexity simulation between Conway's Game of Life and Virtual Worm.

## Project Team
# - Erik Overberg
# - Adam Johnson
# - Riley Rhodes
# - Justin Davis

## Simulation Dynamics
# - Real-time and Accelerated Simulation: The simulation operates in real time and can accelerate up to 100X speed.
# - Life Forms: Includes Plants, Grazers, and Predators, each with specific rules and genetic traits.
# - Obstacles: Boulders in the simulation world affecting life form movement.
# - Reporting: Real-time tracking of life form populations.

## End Conditions
# The simulation concludes when any life form's population reaches zero, indicating ecosystem instability.

## Website Hosting and User Interaction
# - Hosted on a website for multi-user interaction.
# - Users can input data files and review the results.

## Constraints
# - Browser Compatibility: Operable on various web browsers, including Chrome.
# - Open Source: All code must be original.
# - No External Engines: All graphics and controls must be developed in-house.

## Additional Information
# - Initial settings data file provided.
# - Source file for reading simulation data in C++ and Java.

## Project Advice
# - Focus on functionality before balance.
# - Use Conway's Game of Life for inspiration.
# - Effective time management and communication are key.
# - Choose programming languages based on project needs.

## Spring 2022 Recommendations
# - Concentrate on general entity behavior first.
# - Integrate front-end and back-end early.
# - Establish clear communication protocols between front-end and back-end.
