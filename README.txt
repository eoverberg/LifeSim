Hello Welcome to the LIFESIMULATION Group 3 year 2024 assignment. 

First here are the items required to start this program:
Node version: v21.0.0+
NPM version: 10.2.4+
React version: 18.2.0+
React-Dom:  18.2.0+
React-scripts: 5.0.1+
React-router-dom: 18.2.0+
Express: 4.18.3+
fast-xml-parser: 4.3.6+
@mui/Material: 5.15.0+

Once the node, npm,react, and express are installed it is recommended to run the packages to install the most 
up to date versions.
To accomplish this use these commands in one terminal
    cd backend
    npm install -i 
In another terminal use the commands 
    cd client
    npm install -i 

This will again update each version to neccessary required versions.

To run this program you will need a split terminal or two terminals.
On the first terminal use these commands 
    cd client
    npm start
On the second terminal use theses commands
    cd backend/server 
    node index.js

Once greeted with the home page go to the student tab to upload an XML which we convently have
located in backend/server/assets. We advise to use those as a baseline to further build any xmls.
